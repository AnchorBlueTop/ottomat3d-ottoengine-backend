## Get All Printers

### GET `/api/printers/`

- **Status Options:**
    - `ONLINE`: Device is powered on, connected, Klipper is ready.
    - `EJECTING`: Device is actively running a Klipper macro (Klipper state "Printing" or "Busy").

## Execute Ottoeject Macro

### POST `/api/ottoeject/{id}/macros`

- **Description:** Sends a command to the OttoEject to execute a pre-defined Klipper G-code macro.
- **Request Body (JSON):Example (Homing)**
    
    ```json
    {    "macro": "OTTOEJECT_HOME"}
    ```
    
- **Response (202 Accepted - If macro dispatched successfully):**
Indicates the command was sent to the OttoEject. The client (e.g., Python script) should then poll `/api/ottoeject/{id}/status` to determine when the macro has finished (i.e., status returns to "ONLINE").
    
    ```json
    {    
        "message": "Macro 'OTTOEJECT_HOME' command sent to Ottoeject 1.",    
        "moonraker_response": { // Direct response from Moonraker when it accepted the command        
            "result": "ok"    
        }
    }
    ```
    
- **Response (502 Bad Gateway - If macro is long and backend times out waiting for Moonraker ACK):**

**Explanation for Timeout Response:**
The OttoEject (running Klipper/Moonraker) immediately starts executing a long macro. Moonraker might not send an HTTP "OK" back to the backend until Klipper finishes that block of G-code. If this takes longer than the backend's internal timeout to Moonraker (e.g., 30 seconds), the backend will respond with this 502 error. However, the macro is likely still running on the OttoEject. The controlling script must poll the OttoEject's status via `GET /api/ottoeject/{id}/status` to know when the physical action is complete (i.e., when status returns from "EJECTING" to "ONLINE").

```json
{    
    "error": "Macro Execution Proxy Error",    
    "message": "Command 'EJECT_FROM_P1' sent to Ottoeject, but acknowledgement from device timed out. External polling for completion is required. Detail: Failed to execute G-code: No response from 192.168.68.74 (ECONNABORTED)",    
    "moonraker_details": null
}
```
